<p> My name is Marven, and I'm Filipino. I've been a math teacher for 14 years, having worked in both the United States and the Philippines.
  Currently enjoying my sabbatical leave, I'm studying for courses that will help me use my other skills. Right now, forex trading and web development are my main interests.
</p>

<p> I'm hoping that what I'm doing now will help me achieve my life goals of becoming a web developer and becoming financially comfortable through FX trading.
